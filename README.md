# A-system-for-Cognitive-Load-Classification

#Undergraduate Thesis

GSR signal is used to classify human cognitive load. Three tasks were assigned to 40 university students. Three tasks were 1) Math, 2) Reading Comprehension, 3) Sudoku. Data (GSR) was collected from those students using E4 wristband(https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/).  

Also, the student expert ability was measured in this research. Based on this thesis, an international IEEE Conference paper was accepted in ICECTE 2019 (3rd International Conference on Electrical, Computer & Telecommunication Engineering)(https://icecte-ruet.org/). 

For GSR signal processing MATLAB was used and for ML application Python SKlearn was preferred. The code will be available soon.
